# Shards
A personal microblog experiment built upon Merveilles' [Hallway.](https://webring.xxiivv.com/hallway.html)

## Warning
In its current state, this is very rough. It works, but be aware that it mainly consists of a few tweaks I managed to implement while having little understanding of how the whole thing works.

The JavaScript part could probably be optimized a lot, not to mention fonts and CSS. The info.js page is a mess, you'll need to edit it manually to descript your own projects.

The PHP part in the edit folder is probably awful, especially regarding security. If you plan to use it, don't forget to protect your files with .htaccess authentication or something more robust, or anyone will be able to edit your shard file.

## Basic setup
Just edit the scripts/sites.js with your own URL.
